A simple recipe website built with HTML and CSS, created using AI-assisted development and iterative prompt engineering.

## About the Project

This project showcases one of my favorite recipes: **Genovese Pesto Pasta**.  
The goal was to create a clean, warm, and modern personal website while collaborating with an AI tool to generate and improve the code step by step.

The website includes:
- A hero section with a featured recipe
- Ingredients and instructions styled as clean cards
- “Coming soon” sections for Breakfast and Sweets
- A minimal navigation bar and footer

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- AI-assisted coding (ChatGPT – free version)

## Features

- Responsive layout
- At least one image
- Interactive navigation links
- Modern, clean UI inspired by Italian food aesthetics

## AI Usage

An AI tool was used to:
- Generate the initial HTML and CSS structure
- Improve layout, colors, spacing, and typography
- Iterate on design elements such as the hero section and cards
- Refine the user interface through prompt engineering
